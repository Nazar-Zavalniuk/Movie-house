<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<hr/>

<p>This is a single-page application (<strong>SPA</strong>) that use <strong>React Router</strong> for navigation between pages of the site.</p>
<p>The application designed to provide users with a comprehensive platform for discovering and exploring movies. It allows users to browse movies by genres, search for specific titles, and view detailed information about films.</p>
<p><strong>Application design was created for devices with a width of 960px or more.</strong></p>

<p><h3>How it works</h3></p>
<hr/>

<p>Navbar in top of the application allow users filter movies by novelty, premieres, move to search page where users can set multiple filter params, move to homepage and move to random movie and search movie by title.</p>

</div>
<br/>
<p><strong>Since I used <code>Airtable</code> instead of some kind database for store and getting data for the application now you can not register through registration form shown above as i reached limitation of free plan of usage <code>Airtable</code> but you steel can login using next credential:</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Login:</strong> <code>Eli</code>
<br/>
<strong>Passwod:</strong> <code>QrT0A6HKCMVg9j</code>
</p>

<p>In the <strong>filter page</strong> users can set multiple filters to search some movies.</p>

</div>
<p>In the <strong>movie page</strong> users can explore all info about it and copy its title or link to its page.</p>

<p><h3>Additionally</h3></p>
<hr/>

<p>While developing this application, I learned more about the basic principles of building single-page applications (<strong>SPA</strong>), improved my skills in developing applications on <strong>React</strong>, and also gained experience working with <strong>React Router</strong>, <strong>Axios</strong>, and <strong>Ajax</strong> requests.</p>

<p><h3>Getting Started</h3></p>
<hr/>

<p>This project was bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a>.</p>

<p><h4>Available Scripts</h4></p>

<p>In the project directory, you can run:</p>

<p><h4><code>npm start</code></h4></p>

<p>Runs the app in the development mode.</p>
<p>Open <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> to view it in your browser.</p>

<p>The page will reload when you make changes.</p>
<p>You may also see any lint errors in the console.</p>

<p><h4><code>npm test</code></h4></p>

<p>Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.</p>
<p>See the section about <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests">running tests</a> for more information.</p>

<p><h4><code>npm run build</code></h4></p>

<p>Builds the app for production to the <code>build</code> folder.</p>
<p>It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.</p>

<p>The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.</p>
<p>Your app is ready to be deployed!</p>

<p>See the section about <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment">deployment</a> for more information.</p>

<p><h4><code>npm run eject</code></h4></p>

<p><strong>Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you <code>eject</code>, you can't go back!</strong></p>

<p>If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can <code>eject</code> at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.</p>

<p>Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except <code>eject</code> will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.</p>

<p>You don't have to ever use <code>eject</code>. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.</p>
